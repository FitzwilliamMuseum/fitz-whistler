Migrated HTML soup resource for the Fitzwilliam's Whistler exhibition.

This online exhibition forms a survey of the Fitzwilliam Museum’s collection of etchings, drypoints and lithographs by the American artist James Abbott McNeill Whistler (1834-1903). All the works are original prints by Whistler except where stated.

When the prints were displayed at the Fitzwilliam in 2007-8 the exhibition was split into two parts. This online version went live to coincide with the second exhibition, Palaces in the Night: The urban landscape in Whistler’s prints (23 September 2008 - 18 January 2009).
