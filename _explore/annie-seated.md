Etching printed on old laid paper, 1858

Another study of Whistler's niece Annie (see Annie above).

The paper has a watermark of 1814, and the uneven edges are typical of the scraps of old paper that Whistler collected for printing. He later explained to the printer of his lithographs, Thomas Way: 'when the sheet has a cut edge and a rough one, I would always put the straight cut edge at the top' (compare Reading in Bed).

Given by Mrs T. H. Riches 1923
