Etching printed on 'antique' laid paper, 1858

A study of Whistler's half-sister, Deborah Haden, made shortly after Whistler's return to London having completed 'The French set'.

This impression is printed on a fly-leaf torn out of an old book. It bears the inscription in graphite 18/2/62, which may have been the date of printing or purchase. The Rag Gatherers has the same date inscription, so it is possible that this etching was also printed for Serjeant Thomas by Del√¢tre after Thomas had acquired the plates of 'The Set' in 1861.

Given by Mrs T. H. Riches 1923
