Etching printed on thin Japanese paper, 1859

After seeing two of his 'French Set' etchings exhibited at the Paris Salon, Whistler returned to London in May 1859 in time to see two of the etchings exhibited at the Royal Academy exhibition. Over the summer he worked with Haden again, and this print of Whistler's nephew was made on a trip to Kensington Gardens with etching materials. Haden etched his own view of the park at the same time, and collaborated with Whistler on another. Whistler followed The Music Room with a number of other views in and around the leafier parts of London, often with one of his artist friends or relatives in view (see Landscape with Horse, the two impressions of Nursemaid and Child, The Punt and The Thames (Sketching No.1)).

Given by G. J. F. Knowles 1954
