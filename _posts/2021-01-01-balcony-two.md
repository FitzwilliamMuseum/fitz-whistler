Etching and drypoint printed on 'antique' laid paper trimmed by the artist, 1889

This impression of the final state of the plate shows shading added since the impression above was printed (Whistler probably printed only about 12 proofs of this print).

The original mount of the print survives (the right edge has been restored) with the manuscript dedication To Mrs George signed with Whistler's butterfly. The recipient, Elizabeth Lewis (1844-1931), was wife of the lawyer George Lewis, and one of the leading hostesses of her day. Their house in Portland Place was frequented by artists and writers such as Whistler, Oscar Wilde, Henry James and Edward Burne Jones.

Given by Elizabeth, Lady Lewis 1919
