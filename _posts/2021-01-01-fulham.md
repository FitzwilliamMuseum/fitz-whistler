Etching printed on heavy handmade wove paper, 1879

This is one of three etchings of the old Fulham (or Putney) toll bridge that Whistler etched in 1879. The wooden structure had to be constantly repaired and in 1879 was scheduled for replacement by the present stone bridge (constructed 1882-6).

All three of Whistler's prints were published by the Fine Art Society, this one on 28 January 1879, with Whistler providing twenty signed proofs and Frederick Goulding printing the rest of the edition. This proof lacks the blindstamp of the Printsellers' Association used on the published edition. Whistler hoped to stave off bankruptcy with these publications, but failed, and was declared bankrupt in May 1879.

These views of the old Putney Bridge and an etching of the Battersea bridge were the last prints that he made before the Fine Art Society commissioned him to go to Venice in September (see The Venice sets).

Bequeathed by G. J. F. Knowles 1959
