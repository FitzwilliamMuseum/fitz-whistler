Etching and drypoint printed on machine-made wove paper, 1859

This etching shows a view further west than the other views of wharves and docks made in 1859 (Limehouse and Eagle Wharf). The site is the old fish market of Billingsgate, with London Bridge and the tower of Southwark Cathedral in the background on the right. Whistler was probably sitting on the Custom House Stairs to etch it (Charles Haden, Seymour's brother, worked at the Customs House).

This rare impression appears to show an undescribed state of the plate, printed after some of the figures and masts on the left had been burnished away, but before some of the redrawing of the figures and sails. The impression of Billingsgate below is a later state.

Given by Mrs T. H. Riches 1923
