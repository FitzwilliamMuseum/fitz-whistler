Etching printed on Japanese paper, 1858

After printing the plate in its earlier state (see above), Whistler altered the cape and the garment in the left hand, and added extra shading. The address of the printer Auguste Delâtre has also been added. This is the final state as published.

This is one of a group of impressions of early plates in the Fitzwilliam, which were probably not printed before 1861, when the plates of 'The French Set' were reprinted by Delâtre for Serjeant Thomas (see Fumette).

Given by G. J. F. Knowles 1954
