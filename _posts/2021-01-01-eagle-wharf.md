Etching printed on handmade wove paper, 1859

One of several etchings that Whistler made of wharves along Wapping High Street, often with one of the local workers or inhabitants prominently depicted in the foreground. The name of the firm Tyzack, Whiteley, & Co. is visible on the building on the left (Whistler often referred to this plate by the title 'Tyzack Whiteley'). The firm was listed in the 1859 London Directory as 'patent windlass, chain cable and anchor makers' at 266-7 Wapping High Street; at 268 was 'William Brown, sail maker & ship chandler'.

This print is inscribed on the back by Thomas Nelson MacLean (see Limehouse, also from his collection): 'Proof printed by J. Whistler, Given by him to a friend from whom I received it - 1873 - T.N.M.'

Given by Mrs T. H. Riches 1923
