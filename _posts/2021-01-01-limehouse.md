Etching and drypoint printed on laid paper, 1859

Whistler took lodgings in a pub at Wapping from August to October 1859, and made a group of eight etchings. This view of Broadway Wharf is the most easterly of the early Thames etchings, with the Old Harbour Master's House on the right (the name partly visible at the top). The view is reversed, with the wood sheds of West India Docks in the distance.

This impression is inscribed on the back: 'Proof printed by J. Whistler / Given to me by Mrs Whistler - (his Mother) / 1872. T. N. Maclean.' The sculptor Thomas Nelson Maclean (1845-1894) exhibited at the Royal Academy from 1870 and in the 1880s became an ally of Whistler. He married the donor shortly before his death. See Katharine Anne Riches on the Collectors and Donors page.

Given by Mrs T. H. Riches 1923
