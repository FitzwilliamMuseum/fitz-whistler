Etching printed on 'antique' laid paper, 1858

Like Street at Saverne (below) this print was made in Alsace during the outward journey of Whistler's trip to the Rhine in 1858. This print shows the influence of the prints of the Barbizon artist Charles Jacque, which also featured dilapidated half-timbered farmhouses. Jacque in turn was influenced by seventeenth-century Dutch etchings.

The title page and twelve plates that made up 'The French Set' were printed on chine coll√© paper and issued in Paris in an edition of 20 in early November 1858. The London edition of 50 sets was issued a few weeks later. This impression was printed separately on a fly-leaf torn from an old book.

Given by G. J. F. Knowles 1921
