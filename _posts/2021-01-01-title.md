Etching printed on wove paper, 1858

The Paris edition of 'The French Set' was printed on chine collé paper by Auguste Delâtre and issued in an edition of 20 in early November 1858. The London edition of 50 sets was issued a few weeks later with this title plate printed on the large dark-blue paper wrapper containing the other twelve sheets. The plates were reprinted after being bought by Serjeant Ralph Thomas in 1860. This impression was printed separately.

The image was based on a drawing of Whistler's room-mate and travelling companion Ernest Delannoy sketching in the streets of Cologne. In the etching Whistler made it look more like a self-portrait. The dedicatee, Seymour Haden, witnessed some of the printing of the set, and Whistler used his address when publishing the London edition.
