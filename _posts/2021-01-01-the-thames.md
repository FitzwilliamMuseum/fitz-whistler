Etching and drypoint printed on chine coll√©, 1861

In the summer of 1861 Whistler made several etchings and drypoints on trips along the Thames, during visits to the home of Edwin Edwards and his wife Ruth at Sunbury near Hampton Court. This print was made in August 1861 when Edwards, Whistler, Fantin-Latour and Haden made an etching trip along the Thames. Edwards etched Molesey Lock (Whistler on the gate) on the same occasion, using the same sized plate.
