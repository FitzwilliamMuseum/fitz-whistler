Etching and drypoint printed on Japanese paper, 1859

This plate was not published as part of The Thames Set. This is one of the impressions of the final state printed on Japanese paper before the plate was published in The Portfolio in January 1878. Whistler was persuaded to let The Portfolio publish this plate by Ernest Brown, who was later to introduce Whistler to the Fine Art Society, resulting in a series of publications culminating in the first Venice set.

Given by Sir Herbert Thompson 1920
