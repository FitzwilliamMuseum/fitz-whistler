Etching and drypoint printed on Dutch 'antique' laid paper, 1861

In 1860 Whistler spent extended periods working in Rotherhithe, producing views from the balcony of the Angel Inn by Cherry Garden Pier looking across the river to Wapping. He returned again in early 1861 and made additional etchings (Vauxhall Bridge, Millbank, The Little Pool and Early Morning, Battersea) for inclusion in his first one-man exhibition of etchings in April 1861 at the New Bond Street gallery set up by Serjeant Thomas and run by his son Edmund.

This view is taken from the balcony of the Angel looking North-West, but unlike the larger etching from the previous year it does not show figures on the balcony in the foreground and the distant view on the left stops just short of showing the dome of St Paul's Cathedral.

Given by G. J. F. Knowles 1954
