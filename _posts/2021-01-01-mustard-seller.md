Etching printed on Japanese paper, 1858

The plates for this print and The Kitchen (below) were made after Whistler's return to Paris from the Rhine, but the subjects were based on earlier drawings, in this case a study drawn in Cologne and annotated 'Marchand de Potions'. This print was one of two etchings by Whistler accepted for exhibition at the Paris Salon in 1859, even though the two paintings he submitted that year were refused.

This is one of a group of impressions of early plates in the Fitzwilliam, which were probably not printed before 1861, when the plates of 'The French Set' were reprinted by Del√¢tre for Serjeant Thomas (see Fumette).

Given by G. J. F. Knowles 1921
