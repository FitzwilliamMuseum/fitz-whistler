Etching and drypoint printed on chine coll√©, 1861

At the January 1861 meeting of the Junior Etching Club, Whistler agreed to contribute two plates to a collection of etchings to be published by Day & Son. When the publication appeared in 1862 with the title Passages from Modern English Poets, it included this print and The Thames (Sketching No. 1) (see below), retitled River Scene and The Angler.

This plate was probably made on the same etching trip along the Thames as The Thames (Sketching No. 1) below.

Reitlinger Bequest 1950 (received 1991)
