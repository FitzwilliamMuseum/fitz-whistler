Etching printed on 'antique' laid paper, 1858

Made shortly after Whistler's return to London on completing The French Set. Over two months he and Haden worked closely together at the latter's house in Sloane Street, where Haden had installed an etching press. Haden also made an etching of a wine glass, and another of the cup and saucer that appear in Reading by Lamplight (below). Whistler's friend Henri Fantin-Latour made his own painted study of a cup and saucer a few years later during a visit to his friends and patrons Edwin and Ruth Edwards, in 1864 (now in the collection of The Fitzwilliam Museum 1016 ).

This impression is printed on a fly-leaf taken from a sixteenth-century book.

Bought from the Print Duplicates Fund 1941
