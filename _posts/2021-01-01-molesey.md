Edwin Edwards 1823-1879

Etching, 1861

Edwards was a lawyer who later turned to art and music. He went to drawing classes and through a fellow student was introduced to Whistler, Legros, Fantin-Latour and Haden. Legros taught him how to etch in the winter of 1860-61 and he installed a press at his house in Sunbury, where his wife Ruth became skilled at printing. During the 1860s and 70s their home was a meeting place for French and British painters and etchers. This print was made when Edwards, Whistler, Fantin-Latour and Haden made an etching trip along the Thames in August 1861. Whistler etched The Thames (Sketching No. 1) on the same occasion.

Given by Sir Herbert Thompson 1920
