Etching and drypoint printed on old Dutch laid paper, 1861

Like The Rag Gatherers this print was made as an announcement card for Whistler's 1861 exhibition, although it is not certain whether both prints were used. This is the final state of the print as published in the 'Thames Set' in 1871; the previous state had the same two lines of lettering that appear in Millbank. It was made in March, just before the exhibition opened, and probably shows Whistler at work on a pier overlooking the Pool of London (the stretch of river between London Bridge and Rotherhithe) with Serjeant Thomas and his son Ralph. Whistler had etched a different view of 'The Pool' two years earlier.

Given by G. J. F. Knowles 1954
