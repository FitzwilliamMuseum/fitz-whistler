Etching and drypoint printed on Japanese paper, 1859

One of several etchings of figures in a rural landscape (Nursemaid and Child below) made during the visit of Henri Fantin-Latour to stay with Whistler at the Hadens' in the summer of 1859. The figure in the foreground is probably young Seymour (see Seymour, seated and Seymour seated under a Tree). Earlier in the spring in Paris Whistler had formed the Société des Trois (Society of Three) with Fantin-Latour and Alphonse Legros. They shared an admiration for older French artists such as Gustave Courbet and Camille Corot. Traces of the influence of Corot and Legros are evident in this second state in which Whistler added the scribbled draughtsmanship of the trees and the troubled sky (as well as the second horse). The labourers erecting telegraph poles reinforce Whistler's own realist rather than idyllic approach to landscape.
