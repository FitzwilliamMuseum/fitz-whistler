Etching, second state, printed on thin Japanese paper, 1859

After printing the plate in its first state (see above), Whistler changed the profile of Deborah's nose and altered her hair. This impression of the second state was printed on Japanese paper, whilst the first state was printed on European 'antique' laid paper using a browner coloured ink.

Given by G. J. F. Knowles 1921
