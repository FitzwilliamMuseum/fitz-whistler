Théodore Roussel 1847-1926

Etching on 'antique' Dutch(?) laid paper, c.1888-9

The French artist Roussel settled in Chelsea, and in 1885 became a follower of Whistler (out of respect he always went bareheaded in Whistler's presence). Roussel's first original etchings featured local streets and shops in the manner of Whistler's prints of Chelsea in the 1880s. This view shows (in reverse) the corner of Beaufort Street and Cheyne Walk. To the right of the bay-fronted house is Lindsey House, where Whistler lived between 1866 and 1878. This is one of two prints in the Fitzwilliam dedicated by Roussel to Thomas Nelson MacLean, the sculptor whose Whistler prints also came to the Museum via his widow Katharine Anne Riches (see below).

Given by Mrs T. H. Riches 1923
