Etching printed on Japanese paper, 1858

Made in Paris in the summer of 1858 before Whistler's trip to the Rhine. This tinker, a mender of pots and pans, is typical of the subjects of working women from the lowest levels of society that were popular among realist artists in France. The straight-forward, unidealised treatment matches the choice of subject.

This is one of a group of impressions of early plates in the Fitzwilliam, which were probably not printed before 1861, when the plates of 'The French Set' were reprinted by Del√¢tre for Serjeant Thomas (see Fumette).

Given by G. J. F. Knowles 1954
