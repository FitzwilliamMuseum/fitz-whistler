Lithograph printed on 'antique' laid paper, 1890

One of a pair of studies (with The Winged Hat) showing Whistler's sister-in-law, Ethel 'Bunnie' Philips, in fashionable attire. Ethel's sister Beatrice Whistler referred to this print as 'Le Mosquetaire' (a name for the sort of glove worn by a musketeer).

This delicate proof was hand-printed on the eighteenth-century paper that Whistler loved to use for printing. His approval is marked by the addition of his butterfly in graphite (pencil), in addition to the butterfly that was printed as part of the lithograph.

A separate edition was machine-printed in large numbers on modern machine-made paper to appear in the journal The Studio in April 1894.

Bequeathed by G. J. F. Knowles 1959
