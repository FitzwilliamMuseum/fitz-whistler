Wood engraving by the Dalziel Brothers (Edward (1817-1905) and Thomas (1823-1906)) from Whistler's drawing on wood, published in Good Words, 1862.

Like Kenneth and Lena Graeme above this is similar in spirit to those designed by the Pre-Raphaelites and their circle. They illustrate The Trial Sermon, by 'M.C.', in which Kenneth Graeme, a divinity student, decided to base his graduation sermon on an old sermon in a book that his sister Lena was reading, but rather than lose his fianc√©e, Joanna Douglas, he abandoned his plan and the chance of immediate graduation. The model for Joanna was Joanna Hiffernan, a red-haired Irish woman who had been Whistler's mistress since 1861. She was his model in several other prints (see Weary).
