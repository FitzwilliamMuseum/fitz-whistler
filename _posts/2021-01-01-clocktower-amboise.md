Etching printed on Dutch(?) 'antique' laid paper trimmed by the artist, 1888

Like Hôtel de Ville, Loches above, this shows one of the more well-known landmarks of Renaissance architecture among the plates made on Whistler's honeymoon tour of the Loire in the autumn of 1888. But even here, Whistler chose to dwell on the more commonplace buildings in the foreground rather than the clock-tower. The other plate he made in Amboise showed the famous chateau of François I, but again relegated to the distance.

Bequeathed by G. J. F. Knowles 1959
